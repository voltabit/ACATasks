USE STRICT
When using Classes and modules, there's no need to set "use strict" as it is automatically enabled

VARIABLES
let, const, var
var has no block scope: it is either global or function-scoped.
multiple variable declarations with var will not throw an error.
var is hoisted (raised to the top of the function, or script for glabal scope) even in unreachable section of a code.

Declarations are hoisted but assignments are not.
